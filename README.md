# Review App
## Important:
### I realised that React and other dynamic applications are not supported on GitHub. This page will land soon somewhere else. Then, i will link it overhere as preview.
Link below shows an empty page with only "root" element of React and a few errors in console. Nothing to see for you, my visitors.
### Live Preview link: [GitHub Previw](https://szablitho.github.io/Review-App-with-React-and-TS/)

## Tools

React + TypeScript + Vite, ESLint, Prettier

## Current state:

In the app you can edit one of a post to your name and text, close and open "New Post" modal. Website is responsive to high extent. I'm working towards reprogramming components to add new post on Submit event.

### Future of project

Also, I consider adding back-end funcionality to keep posted content on page, but this requires hosting provider switch as GitHub doesn't support back-end functionality.
