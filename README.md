# Review App

### Live Preview link:

## Tools

React + TypeScript + Vite, ESLint, Prettier

## Current state:

In the app you can edit one of a post to your name and text, close and open "New Post" modal. Website is responsive to high extent. I'm working towards reprogramming components to add new post on Submit event.

### Future of project

Also, I consider adding back-end funcionality to keep posted content on page, but this requires hosting provider switch as GitHub doesn't support back-end functionality.
